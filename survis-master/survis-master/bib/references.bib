	abstract = {Smart policing refers to the use of advanced technologies such as artiﬁcial intelligence to enhance policing activities in terms of crime prevention or crime reduction. Artiﬁcial intelligence tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, have widespread applications across various ﬁelds, such as healthcare, business, and law enforcement. By means of these technologies, smart policing enables organizations to efﬁciently process and analyze large volumes of data. Some examples of smart policing applications are ﬁngerprint detection, DNA matching, CCTV surveillance, and crime prediction. While artiﬁcial intelligence offers the potential to reduce human errors and biases, it is still essential to acknowledge that the algorithms reﬂect the data on which they are trained, which are inherently collected by human inputs. Considering the critical role of the police in ensuring public safety, the adoption of these algorithms demands careful and thoughtful implementation. This paper presents a systematic literature review focused on exploring the machine learning techniques employed by law enforcement agencies. It aims to shed light on the beneﬁts and limitations of utilizing these techniques in smart policing and provide insights into the effectiveness and challenges associated with the integration of machine learning in law enforcement practices.},

There is a lack of information regarding the circumstances under which police are more or less likely to use this device and, in particular, there is limited information as to potential racial discrepancies.The present study tests for a relationship between suspects’ race and police officers’ use of Tasers. The findings suggest the presence of a moderate relationship, with Hispanic suspects being twice as likely as Whites to have Tasers used against them. Hispanic ethnicity, although not the primary determinant of Taser use, proved to increase the likelihood that a suspect would be subdued with a Taser.This finding has implications for police policy and for future research.},

	abstract = {The use of force by police officers is a regular source of interest among the public, media, scholars, and criminal justice professionals. Tasers have emerged as an important and increasingly popular technology for police departments. Despite the increasing adoption and use of Tasers and the controversy surrounding their use, relatively little prior research examines the factors associated with Taser use by police officers. Guided by the focal concerns theoretical perspective, the current study uses data from a medium-size police department to analyze the factors that influence Taser use. Logistic regression models provide evidence that Taser use is influenced by suspect resistance as well as the race and gender of the suspect involved. Implications for policy and research are discussed.},

	abstract = {The police must on occasion use physical force and weapons in order to apprehend and control subjects and fulfil the police function. It is inevitable that some of these interactions will result in injuries to both subjects and officers, with a range of both tangible and intangible harms and costs. It is therefore important to study injuries related to the use of force with an eye toward identifying opportunities to minimize injury and reduce the harms and costs. Injuries to both subjects and officers were examined in a sample of more than 10,000 use of force incidents drawn from 81 agencies located in 8 states. In addition to describing injury rates across a broad spectrum of situational and agency characteristics, we present multilevel logistic regression models predicting subject and officer injury. Among key findings, we report that the likelihood of injury for both subjects and officers is lower when force incidents end quickly and with the minimal necessary superior level of force relative to subject resistance, and higher for both subjects and officers when subjects flee. At the agency level, we find that the likelihood of injury varies by agency size and type. Finally, we explored possible higher-level variation and found that agencies in the sample from Midwestern states (primarily Wisconsin) have substantially lower injury rates that appear to be associated with their less frequent use of weapons and greater reliance on low-level physical force tactics, as compared to agencies in the sample from Western and other states.},

	abstract = {Purpose Police officers in the USA are often put in harm’s way when responding to calls for service. This paper provides a demonstration of concept for how machine learning procedures combined with conformal prediction inference can be properly used to forecast the amount of risk associated with each dispatch. Accurate forecasts of risk can help improve officer safety.
Methods The unit of analysis is each of 1928 911 calls involving weapons offenses. Using data from the calls and other information, we develop a machine learning algorithm to forecast the risk that responding officers will face. Uncertainty in those forecasts is captured by nested conformal prediction sets.
Results For approximately a quarter of a holdout sample of 100 calls, a forecast of high risk was correct with the odds of at least 3 to 1. For approximately another quarter of the holdout sample, a forecast of low risk was correct with an odds of at least 3 to 1. For remaining cases, insufficiently reliable forecasts were identified. A result of “can’t tell” is an appropriate assessment when the data are deficient.
Conclusions Compared to current practice at the study site, we are able to forecast with a useful level of accuracy the risk for police officers responding to calls for service. With better data, such forecasts could be substantially improved. We provide examples.},

Early intervention systems (EISs) that flag officers considered most likely to be involved in one of these adverse events are an important tool for police supervision and for targeting interventions such as counseling or training. However, the EISs that exist are not data-driven and based on supervisor intuition. We have developed a data-driven EIS that uses a diverse set of data sources from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and machine learning techniques to more accurately predict the officers who will have an adverse event. Our approach is able to significantly improve accuracy compared with their existing EIS: Preliminary results indicate a 20\% reduction in false positives and a 75\% increase in true positives.},

	Abstract = {African Americans are nearly three times as likely to be killed by police as whites. This paper examines whether this racial disparity is due in part to racial differences in the circumstances of police killings. To assess whether and how these circumstances predict the race of a decedent, I use machine learning techniques and a novel data set of police killings containing over 120 descriptors. I find that decedent characteristics, criminal activity, threat levels, police actions, and the setting of the lethal interaction are not predictive of race, indicating that the police—given contact—are killing blacks and whites under largely similar circumstances. The findings suggest that the racial disparity in the rate of lethal force is most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force.},

	abstract = {Fairness in policing, driven by the effective and transparent investigation and remediation of police misconduct, is vital to maintaining the legitimacy of policing agencies, and the capacity for police to function within society. Research into police misconduct in Australia has traditionally been performed on an ad-hoc basis, with limited access to law enforcement data. This research seeks to identify the antecedents of serious police misconduct, resulting in the dismissal or criminal charge of officers, among a large police misconduct dataset. Demographic and misconduct data were sourced for a sample of 600 officers who have committed instances of serious misconduct, and a matched sample of 600 comparison officers across a 13-year period. A machine learning analysis, random forest, was utilised to produce a robust predictive model, with Partial Dependence Plots employed to demonstrate within variable interaction with serious misconduct. Prior instances of serious misconduct were particularly predictive of further serious misconduct, while misconduct was most prominent around mid-career. Secondary employment, and performance issues were important predictors, while demographic variables typically outperformed complaint variables. This research suggests that serious misconduct is similarly prevalent among experienced officers, as it is junior officers, while secondary employment is an important indicator of misconduct risk. Findings provide guidance for misconduct prevention policy among policing agencies.},

Methods: Using a unique complaint dataset from the NYPD, we apply a sequence of machine learning analytics to consider if it is possible to predict serious misconduct among either group, and whether key predictors differ between groups.
Results: The results show that it was possible to predict serious misconduct among each group with considerable confidence, while there were notable differences in prevalence, and type of misconduct between sexes.
Conclusions: Findings hold important implications for policy, prevention and analytical approaches to police misconduct.},
